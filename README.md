# Oblique Strategies

## About

Oblique Strategies are a set of ambiguous prompts created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to overcome creative blockage by either adding tension through restriction or through orthogonal inspiration.

Something like the I Ching for artists.

The original format is a deck of cards. This uses gifs. It uses the Giphy API to retrieve a (somewhat) related gif to each strategy. For additional inspiration, "Dadaist-Mode" can be enabled which returns a random gif.
