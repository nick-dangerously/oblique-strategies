# Oblique Strategies

## About

Oblique Strategies are a set of ambiguous prompts created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to overcome creative blockage by either adding tension through restriction or through orthogonal inspiration.

Something like the I Ching for artists.

The original format is a deck of cards.
